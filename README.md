# Introduction: These are my initial streamlit codes.

# Uploading a specific CSV file: Begin by uploading a single CSV file. Multiple files cannot be added.

# File size limitation: Ensure the CSV file is not larger than 200MB. Large files may result in longer processing times for graph and dataframe visualization due to the increased data volume.

# Displaying dataframe information: Once the file is uploaded, the dataframe will be displayed, showing the number of rows and columns, as well as column data types.

# Numeric column analysis: For numeric columns, you can explore the data further with a five-number summary and a distribution bar plot to examine the shape of each column's distribution.

# Non-numeric column analysis: If non-numeric columns are selected, you can observe the proportion of each category and corresponding bar count plot.

# Handling incorrect dataframes: If the displayed dataframe is incorrect, ensure your CSV file uses the correct separation method.
